# Macroeconomic Forecasting using PCA and Time Series Analysis

## Overview

This project applies econometric and statistical techniques to analyse and forecast macroeconomic variables using high-dimensional macroeconomic data.

The analysis focuses on dimensionality reduction and forecasting using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and time series methods.

## Methods Used

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Time Series Analysis
- Stationarity Testing (ADF test)
- Forecasting models
- Data preprocessing and transformation

## Tools and Technologies

- R
- tidyverse
- ggplot2
- forecast
- tseries

## Skills Demonstrated

- Econometric modelling
- Macroeconomic data analysis
- Time series forecasting
- Dimensionality reduction
- Statistical programming in R
