# Macroeconomic Forecasting using PCA and Time Series Models

## Project Overview

This project builds a macroeconomic forecasting model using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and diffusion index methodology on high-dimensional macroeconomic data from the FRED-MD database.

The objective is to evaluate whether factor-based models improve forecast accuracy compared to traditional autoregressive models.

## Dataset

- Source: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED-MD)
- Number of variables: 120+
- Time period: 1961–2019
- Frequency: Monthly

## Methods

- PCA factor extraction
- Static factor model
- Rolling window forecasting
- Diffusion Index model
- AR(6) benchmark model
- Out-of-sample evaluation

## Results

Key findings:

- PCA factors explain ~48% of total variation
- Diffusion index models do not outperform AR benchmark
- Factor models show instability post-2010
